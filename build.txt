This project involves the development of a collaborative platform designed to foster innovation within an organization. The platform will enable employees to submit, collaborate on, and evaluate ideas while ensuring robust functionality, usability, and adherence to business rules. The system will be built using Django (for backend) and React Vite (for frontend). Below is a detailed breakdown of the project and its interfaces and functionalities.

It will also provide robust auditing and incentivization mechanisms to ensure active participation.

Target Users
Employees: Submit ideas, vote, and collaborate on ideas.
Regional Managers: Evaluate and track the progress of ideas within their regions.
Global Innovation Managers: Oversee and prioritize ideas across regions for global implementation.
Core Components
User Interfaces for different roles with tailored functionalities.
Core Functionalities including idea submission, voting, collaboration tools, and incentives.
AI Integration to enhance idea management and collaboration.
Audit and Tracking mechanisms for transparency.
Technical Requirements to ensure scalability, security, and offline support.
